##Command Pattern

##Description

* Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time.
* The client that creates a command is not the same client that executes it. This separation provides flexibility in the timing and sequencing of commands.
