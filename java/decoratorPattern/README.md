#Decorator Pattern

## **Description**

* Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.

* This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.
