#Adapter pattern

## **Intent**

* The adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
* Works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. 
* This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.
