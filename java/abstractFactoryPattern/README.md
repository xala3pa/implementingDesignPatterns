#Abstract Factory Pattern

## **Intent**

* Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* A hierarchy that encapsulates: many possible "platforms", and the construction of a suite of "products".
* The `new` operator considered harmful.

## **Structure**
